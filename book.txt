A WORD FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS
Dear Students,
I want to take this opportunity to welcome you into the KUST community. You will find that you have
embarked on a journey which will provide plenty of opportunities for growth and development and that all of
us here at KUST want to help and support you in your efforts.
OSAR coordinates all aspects of the co-curricular experience. Our goal is to provide a high-quality
experience that not only complements, but also enriches the learning that takes place in classrooms. We
promote and facilitate this growth through programs, facilities, resources, and support for each student. In
fact, KUST’s program emphasis is not based on memorization, grades, or class rank, but on critical thinking
through participation in hypothesis-driven research, development of strong practical skills and dedication to
responsible, professional behavior. Our academic programs challenge you to think critically and prepare you
for professional success.
We in the OSAR are delighted to get to know you and help you in your journey towards becoming
professional in your field of choice. We encourage you to take full advantage of the KUST system, a
philosophy of education built on the belief that you are responsible adults who come here recognizing the
intrinsic rewards of the education you are receiving. It’s an approach to learning that gives you the freedom to
delve deeply into areas of inquiry stimulated by intellectual curiosity and the desire to learn. As a community,
KUST has developed some rules intended to help us in living and working together as harmoniously as
possible. It is your responsibility to know these regulations, because upon registering, students agree to
conform to the high expectations, and policies set forth in this Student Handbook, and other KUST’s
documents. It is beneficial for the student to become familiar with the information contained within this
handbook— the policies, procedures, and inherent consequences of violation of the expectations set forth.
Dear students, a university is a place where scholars of different backgrounds and expertise come together
to engage in healthy, meaningful discourse. Inherent in this environment is the notion that well-meaning
people will disagree, sometimes passionately, over important issues and events. This disagreement is at the
heart of the educational endeavor and should be viewed as a positive, needed process, one which leads to a
greater understanding of truth. Only when this discourse takes on a personal element does it become harmful
and counterproductive to the mission of the university. As students, you have the ability to affect this
environment by challenging each of the educators that you encounter in your journey. Whether they be
faculty, administrators, support staff, even other students and, each interaction you have will carry with it an
opportunity for growth.
I ask you to read KUST’s vision, mission, and objective statement, to respect the values espoused therein,
and to challenge us to represent those values in our daily actions and decisions. We in turn will ask you to be
a valuable member of our community and to take your education seriously.
Members of the OSAR staff take great pride in working as collaborative partners, and I hope you will take full
advantage of every opportunity presented to you during your time at KUST, and please do not hesitate to
contact us if we can be of assistance to you, because we are here to support you, and there is much to learn,
so let’s get started together.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Kawis Aziz Faraj, PhD
Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs

PART ONE
1.1 Glossary
Add/ Drop: A course (s) in the semester; however, the student is still registered for the semester.
Admission Requirements: Requirements set by the MHESR in Kurdistan and KUST for admitting students
to academic and non-academic programs.
Assessment: Tools and practices used by KUST and its academic programs to measure their achievements
in fulfilling the University/ College/ Department mission, objectives and learning outcomes. The University
community participates in assessment processes.
Attendance: Students registered for any course are expected to attend all lectures and must attend all
laboratories, examinations, quizzes, and practical exercises. Those who miss classes or laboratories are
subject to penalties specified by MHESR and KUST’s regulations for that course.
Bachelor’s Degree: A credential awarded upon the successful completion of a program requiring at least
four or five academic years, meeting institutional and academic standards. According to MHESR instructions,
the maximum time allowed to complete the degree is the standard duration plus half of that duration. For
example, a four-year program must be completed within a maximum of six years.
Corequisite: A co-requisite is a course that has to be taken at the same time as another course. If a course
has a corequisite, it is specified in the flowchart.
Course Grade: It is a grade earned by a student after completing course requirements.
Course Code: Courses in the KUST’s catalogue are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned
by KUST’s Board of Trustees. A three-letter and four-digit numbering system used to designate each course
at KUST. The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject
matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a
course is offered. Rather, the assigned prefix to identify the course is determined by its content.
Credit Hours: This is the standard unit of measurement for university-level work applicable toward a degree.
One credit hour is equal to one 50-minute class period per week, per semester. Thus, the usual
three-credit-hour course is based on meeting 150 minutes per week for a semester. For laboratory work, one
credit hour is equal to two or three hours of laboratory work. Thus, a laboratory that meets for one
two-hour/three-hour session once a week for a semester would have one hour of credit.
Cumulative GPA: It is calculated GPA of all completed courses by a student.
Curriculum: A program that includes in- and out-class instructional and training processes which lead to
fulfillment of an academic degree.
Dean’s List: Undergraduate students who complete 60% or more graded credit hours with the average GPA
of total credit hours should be no less than 3.3 and above are considered to be “Dean’s List” students for that
semester. Dean’s List designation will be listed on the student’s transcript. A congratulatory letter from OSAR
confirming this designation will be provided.
Degree: An award conferred by KUST based on the recommendation of the department. The department
recommends such a degree based on the successful completion of a program of study.
Degree Requirements: Requirements set by the MHESR in Kurdistan, academic program at KUST and an
accreditation agency to award a Bachelor degree to a student upon his/her graduation.
7
Department and College: A department is the basic academic unit at KUST. It consists of a group of faculty
members and their chairperson. The department appoints faculty, develops courses and programs, and
advises students. Departments with related interests (e.g., accounting, economics and finance, management,
and marketing and advertising) are organized into colleges.
Elective Course: One of many courses that the student may choose to earn certain credit hours, KUST will
list some elective courses to enhance student learning and live experience.
Examination: Usually longer than a test and more comprehensive. Preparation is required. No open book or
notebook. Examination questions should assess learning outcomes of the course. The examination must be
scheduled if the students are informed of the date for the test.
Direct Exam: An assessment option allowing students to complete a course through a single comprehensive
final exam, bypassing regular class attendance. Typically offered to students attempting a course for the third
time after previous failures, a DE evaluates a student’s knowledge of the course material in one examination.
Eligibility often requires junior or senior status, prior failures unrelated to attendance issues, and a modified
fee arrangement.
Field Experience: The KUST curriculum includes a number of courses that allow or require students to work
for credit in a professional or career setting. Sometimes the experience is part of a regular course; other
times it is a separate course. In the latter case, the course may have in its title an expression such as
‘cooperative education,’ ‘field experience,’ ‘internship,’ ‘practicum,’ ‘special project,’ or ‘student teaching.’
Final Grade: It is the last assignment (final exam, project, paper, etc.) that a student requires to complete
before receiving the grades for the course. The weight of the final assignment must be stated in the Course
Syllabus.
Freshman: Students who have completed 0–29% of the total required credit hours.
Sophomore: Students who have completed 30–59% of the total required credit hours.
Junior: Students who have completed 60–89% of the total required credit hours.
Senior: Students who have completed 90–100% of the total required credit hours.
Full-Time Student: An undergraduate student is considered full-time if enrolled in a minimum of 15 credit
hours per semester (up to a maximum of 18, or 21 with departmental approval). For students in medical
departments, the minimum requirement is 18 credit hours per semester.
Grade Point Average (GPA): The grade point average is a way of mathematically computing academic
performance. It is determined by assigning a value to each letter grade, multiplying by the number of credit
hours in the course, and dividing by the total number of hours completed. The GPA is the standard measure
for retention and graduation requirements. KUST is on a four-point system, which means that an A grade is
assigned a value of four points (sometimes called quality points), a B three points, a C two points, a D one
point, and an F zero points. Plus, and minus grades (e.g., B+ or B-) are used at KUST. The GPA is truncated
at three digits.
Graduation Requirements: Requirements defined by the University, College, and Department to award a
bachelor degree. These requirements must be fulfilled by the student prior to his/her graduation.
Major: A major is a degree-seeking student’s primary area of academic concentration.
MyKomar: a web-based application enabling students to view all his/her courses and grades as well as
registering eligible courses per semester.
8
Non-credit Work: This refers to a variety of KUST educational offerings that are not applicable to a degree. It
includes work done in the Center for Intensive English Program, Developmental Skills, Internship, and most
of the professional development classes offered through off-campus credit.
Non-University Persons, Groups, and Organizations: Persons, groups or organizations who do not meet
the definitions of persons, groups, or organizations including those groups and organizations which exist
primarily for the purpose of carrying on commercial activity for profit, or which otherwise exist primarily for
private individual gain or benefit.
Notification of Grades: At the end of each semester, OSAR notifies enrolled students of grades earned.
These grades become a part of the official student permanent record and are not subject to change.
Part Time Student: An undergraduate student is considered part-time if enrolled in fewer than 15 credit
hours per semester for non-medical departments or fewer than 18 credit hours per semester for medical
departments.
President’s List: Undergraduate students who complete 60% or more graded credit hours with the average
GPA of total credit hours should be no less than 3.3 and above are considered to be “President’s List”
students for that semester.
President’s List designation will be listed on the student’s transcript. A
congratulatory letter from OSAR confirming this designation will be provided.
Prerequisite: A prerequisite is a course that a student must take and pass before he/ she can take another
related course. If a course has a prerequisite, it is listed in the course description in the KUST’s Catalogue.
(Ex. Calculus I, is a prerequisite to Calculus II).
Pre Final Grade: It is an accumulated grade from any assessment tools prior to taking the final exam or
assignment. Usually, the breakdown of the grade to different assessment tools and their weights are stated in
the Course Syllabus.
Private Events: A private event held on the university campus is one that is open to attendance only by
members and invited guests of the host organization or person.
Public Events: A public event held on the university campus is open to attendance by all members of the

2.2.6. Values and Moral Standards
The moral norm which guides conduct and performance and directs all policy at KUST is responsible
freedom. Freedom is an important experience which the University provides all of its members: faculty,
students, administrators, and staff. Freedom is responsibly exercised when it is directed by ethical standards.
KUST recognizes the need for the development of the whole person. It maintains a comprehensive
educational program ranging from classroom instruction to research and creative activities to achieve this
development.
KUST provides an opportunity for students to learn to express themselves; to think critically; to gain an
understanding of and respect for self and others; to understand the world, the role of science and technology,
and social and cultural achievements; and to develop specialized talents for a career. This is done with a
clearer understanding of the moral issues accompanying development of knowledge and skills and their
application in professional life.
KUST shares a commitment to protect the dignity of each person through academic activities, taking part in
social, intellectual, and physical activities whereby students find many avenues for developing their
personalities as a whole. With academic freedom comes diversity of thoughts and ideas. So, the University is
committed to the principle of civil dialogue and encourages practicing this type of freedom.
KUST shares commitment to the rule of law and expects its members to abide by the laws of the city of
Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan region, and Iraq, as well as University rules and regulations. The University strongly
condemns using alcoholic beverages and drugs and all forms of sexual harassment. It will take suitable legal
and disciplinary actions against any violations.
KUST aspires to excellence in its core activities of teaching, learning, creative expression, and public service
and is committed to the integrity of the academic process. The Academic Honor Code is a specific
manifestation of this commitment. Truthfulness in one’s claims and representations and honesty in one’s
activities are essential in life and vocation, and the realization of truthfulness and honesty is an intrinsic part
of the educational process.
KUST is committed to non-discrimination based on religion, nationality, or political affiliation. This commitment
applies in all areas with students, faculty, and other University personnel. It addresses recruiting, hiring,
promotions and training.
Responsible students recognize that freedom means the acknowledgment of responsibility to the following:
justice and public order; fellow students’ rights and interests; to the University, its rules, regulations, and
accepted traditions; to parents, teachers, and all others whose support makes one’s advanced education
possible in the city, the region and the country. Students are urged to use their freedom in the University
community to develop habits of responsibility which lead to the achievement of academic goals and personal
and social values.
12
2.2.7. Non-Discrimination Statement
Discrimination and harassment against any person because of race, color, religion or creed, sex, pregnancy,
national or ethnic origin, disability, age, ancestry, marital status, political beliefs, or affiliations are prohibited.
This non-discrimination policy applies to admissions, enrollment, scholarships, loan programs, athletics,
employment, and access to services, participation in, and treatment in all university centers, programs, and
activities.

3.1.2 Registration
After notification of official acceptance into a degree program, students must be properly registered and have
their tuition fees paid for all courses they are attending. No student shall be permitted to attend a class
without processing an online registration form via MyKomar or filling the add/drop form at OSAR.
The semester consists of 13 weeks prior to which a schedule of classes is published on the KUST website. It
lists the courses that are to be offered, their meeting times and locations, and the instructors. A normal
undergraduate program load is 15 credits each semester. Fifteen semester credit hours are considered the
minimum full-time load for non-medical departments and eighteen credit hours for medical departments.
Students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher may request extra course load with the consent of an academic advisor.
3.1.2.1. Procedure
3.1.2.1.1. Preregistration
Prior to the commencement of each semester, the OSAR initiates a preregistration period through the
MyKomar system. This period allows students to indicate their intended courses for the forthcoming
semester, subject to the KUST’s established maximum course load policies. Participation in pre registration is
mandatory; students who do not engage in this process will be ineligible for formal course enrollment in the
upcoming semester.
3.1.2.1.2. Registration
Course registration usually starts a couple of weeks before the semester starts in which students are grouped
based on their admission year. Each group is given a day within the registration period to register for their
courses in a chronological order. A time period is allowed for online course registration in which the students
can register for the courses they are eligible for provided all the registration rules are met. Due to the limited
number of seats available, the registration is on a first come, first served basis. Thus, the students are
responsible for registering for the courses within their allocated time period.
Corequisite Policy:
●
Corequisites are not permitted under standard conditions. Exceptions are allowed only in the following
cases:
○
The student has previously failed the prerequisite course twice, allowing concurrent enrollment
in both prerequisite and subsequent course in the same semester, provided that the maximum
credit hour (CH) limit is observed. The student has failed the prerequisite once and has not yet
reached the standard CH requirement for the semester. Corequisites are only permitted if
alternative course combinations cannot meet the CH requirement (e.g., reaching 15 CH
through alternative courses).
○
The student is in their final semester, with a total CH not exceeding 24.
3.1.2.2. Flowcharts
At the university level, a flowchart is a formalized graphic representation of the logical logic sequence of the
curriculum, outlining the steps in the process of course registration from the sophomore year of study to the
graduation stage in a specific academic department. The flowcharts present information on program
preparation in a summarized form, and may be used as a quick reference to check student progress.
A prerequisite is defined as a requirement that a student officially must fulfill before he or she is entitled to
taking a course or privilege. For example, Principles of Microeconomics (BUS2310) is a prerequisite course
for the Principles of Macroeconomics (BUS2311) course.
15
3.1.2.3. Sample of the flowchart
3.1.2.4. Student Responsibility

inside or outside Kurdistan.
KUST keeps the right to offer courses based on module or semester length. In any chosen period, offered
classes should not be less than the International Standards as identified by the International Accreditation
agencies.
16
3.1.2.6. Student Council Rights
The Student Council may suggest offering courses to the University Council based on the availability of the
minimum number of students and right instructor(s) for the course. The University Council may approve or
disapprove the submitted suggestion.
3.1.2.7. Priority of Registration
Priority is given to students who are close to graduation.
Note:
A student is not officially registered for classes until he/ she has completed the entire registration process for
that semester, including the payment of tuition and fees.

5.1.3. Course Withdrawal
Students are responsible for maintaining written evidence of all course withdrawals. Telephone and email
withdrawals will not be accepted. Failure to attend classes or verbal notification to instructors does not
constitute an official course withdrawal. To withdraw from a course, a student must complete a Course
Withdrawal Form. Students who withdraw a course without filing the proper form will receive a failing grade of
“F”. If a student withdraws a course before the middle of the semester (except in a summer term); the
withdrawal course will not appear on the permanent academic record. After this date, a “W” will appear on the
permanent record for each course withdrawal. The “W” is not used in the computation of the semester and
cumulative grade point average. The last day to withdraw a course without receiving a failing grade (F) is (10)
working day after the middle of the semester for regular semesters and 5 working days for summer
semesters).
5.2. Student Attendance
Students registered for any course are expected to attend all lectures and must attend all laboratories,
examinations, quizzes, and practical exercises, and are subject to penalties specified by the instructor for that
course.
Students who miss class must obtain permission from the course instructor to make up missed work. This
permission must be requested at the earliest possible opportunity and before the absence, if possible. The
make-up class must be completed within two weeks after the absence. In the case of missed final
examinations, the following policies will apply. In excused circumstances, the instructor, with the agreement
of the academic unit head offering the course, may require an alternative to make up for the missed work.
Any absence may affect the student’s grade.
21
Instructors need not give substitute assignments or examinations to students who miss classes without
official permission.
It is worth mentioning that Komar University’s Absence Policies and Procedures are based on the regulations
of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.
5.2.1. Absence
Faculty members are responsible for recording students’ daily attendance in MyKomar. The department
chairpersons have the right to officially notify those faculty members who fail to record the attendance. Failing
to abide by this policy will affect the faculty’s semester and annual evaluation, which will be considered for
contract renewal.
When students miss a class, an automatic email notification will be sent to them from MyKomar.
When students’ absence rate exceeds 10% of the total course hours without any official excuse, the system
will automatically mark the student as a failure in the course.
Students whose absence rate exceeds 10% of the total course hours but provide an official excuse to OSAR
will be given an absence margin up to 15%. However, students whose absence rate exceeds the 15% of the
total course hours will be automatically marked as a failure in the course by the system even if they have an
official excuse.
5.2.2. Late
Each student has the right to be late only three times in each course and for only ten minutes.
Students may be allowed into class after being late for more than ten minutes; however, they will be
considered absent. In such cases, students are free to attend the class or not.
5.2.3. Excuse
Faculty members may grant each student one excused absence per course per semester that does not
impact the student's overall attendance rate.
5.3. Incomplete Grade (I)
An “I” is given to a course with the following conditions:
●
Students have earned passing grades in Pre Final Grade, e.g. 45.5 out of 70.
●
Student has extreme conditions which prevent him/her from completing the final assignment, such as:
○
Death of first-degree family member,
○
Medical report, and
○
Prison.
●
Students must request “I” by filling a form, signed by the course chairperson and OSAR. In the form, the
pre-final grade must be stated and the kind of final assignment is identified.
●
Students have up to eight weeks from starting a new semester to fulfill the final assignment. Failing in
achieving that leads to “Zero” in the final assignment and the course grade will be the same as the
pre-final grade.
●
Students have the right to have “I” in all courses starting from the date where a hard condition occurs.
●
Students can’t register in a course if the prerequisite course has a grade “I”.
22
5.4. Second Chance Exam
Based on MHESR regulation No. 1 for 2009 approved on 30/08/2009 regarding exam instructions, students
who will not attend a final exam with or without excuse have the right for the second chance to take the final
exam. Therefore, the following regulations apply on the student:
5.4.1. Official Permission

●
Students can’t register in a course if the prerequisite course has a grade “f”.
5.4.2. Medical Report Procedure
KUST adheres to MHESR policies for accepting medical reports, particularly during exams. To streamline
this, KUST has developed a Health Permission Service (HPS) mobile app, integrated with MyKomar. Once
approved by the healthcare provider, sick leave permissions are automatically sent to teachers through
MyKomar. Healthcare providers have full authority to approve or reject sick leave requests.
5.4.3. No Official Permission
When a student has no official permission, he/she has the right to retake final exam (or assignment) with the
following instructions:

50% of the remaining grade.
●
A letter “f” grade will be given to the course until completing the assignment.
●
Students must complete the required assignment in one semester even if the course is not offered.
●
A letter “f” grade will be replaced with the earned grade with a note that the new grade was earned in the
second chance. If the student doesn’t get a new grade, then the “f” grade will become the final grade.

Students can’t register in a course if the pre-requisite course has a grade “f”.
5.4.4. Failing the course
Students have the right to take the second chance provided that the points mentioned in sections (5.4.2) and
(5.4.3) are observed.
23
5.4.5. Grade Appeals System
The purpose of the grade appeals system is to afford an opportunity for a student to appeal a final course
grade under certain circumstances. Faculty judgment of students’ academic performance is inherent in the
grading process and hence should not be overturned except when the student can show that the grade
awarded represents a gross violation of the instructor’s own specified evaluation (grading) statement and
therefore was awarded in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner. The evaluation (grading)
statement utilized during the grade appeals process is the one contained in the instructor’s syllabus at the
beginning of the semester.
Step 1
Students have (24) hours from the date and time that the final grade is released to contact OSAR to submit a
completed grades appeal form. The Exam Committee reviews and informs OSAR of its findings.
Step 2
If the outcome of the first step is not satisfactory to the student, he/ she may submit a written statement to the
program or department chair within one week. This statement must include an account of attempts to resolve
the issue, as well as the evidence that forms the basis for the appeal. The program or chair will attempt to
arrange a joint meeting of the Appeal, and Exam Committee and OSAR to resolve the issue. This is needed
to be completed within one-week period after the chair receives the written statement.
5.5. Repeated Courses
Undergraduate students are permitted to repeat courses in which they received a fail grade or for GPA
enhancement purposes.
Degree credit for a repeated course will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall
be permanently recorded on the Official Transcript. Repeated course units excluded in a student’s GPA will
be removed from the number of units attempted, as well as balance points so in computing the GPA, only the
grade and corresponding grade points earned the second time a course is taken will be used.
The number of “*” followed by the course name indicates the number of times the course is repeated.
5.6. Academic Honor
The statement on values and moral Standards at KUST says: “The moral norm which guides conduct and
informs policy at KUST is responsible freedom.” Freedom is an important experience that the university, one
of the freest of institutions, provides for its entire community members (faculty, students, administrators, and
staff). Freedom is responsibly exercised when it is guided by ethical standards.
Truthfulness in one’s claims and representations and honesty in one’s activities are essential in life and
vocation, and the realization of truthfulness and honesty is an intrinsic part of the educational process.
Guided by these principles, this Academic Honor Policy outlines the university’s expectations for students’
academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and
responsibilities of students and faculty throughout the process.
24
5.7. Academic Honor Pledge
None-Medical:
I Pledge to apply all my knowledge and skills gained at KUST for the benefit of humanity and nature! I pledge
my loyalty and commitment To the philosophy and objectives of the university no matter where destiny may

important decisions, maintain confidentiality, and treat all individuals with respect, regardless of their
background. With unwavering integrity, I'll continually improve my skills and serve humanity through my
profession.
5.8. Academic Student Rights

process:
●
To be informed of all alleged violation(s), receive the complaint in writing and be given access to all
relevant materials pertaining to the case.
●
To receive an impartial hearing in a timely manner where they will be given a full opportunity to present
information pertaining to the case.

speak on the student’s behalf.
●
To choose not to answer any question that might be incriminating.
●
To contest the sanctions of a first-level agreement and to appeal both the decision and sanctions of an
Academic Honor Hearing.
The student has the right to continue in the course in question during the entire process. Once a student has
received notice that he/she is being charged with an alleged violation of the Academic Honor Policy, the
student is not permitted to withdraw or drop the course unless the final outcome of the process dictates that
no academic penalty will be imposed. In the event that final determination is not made before the end of the
term, the grade of
‘Incomplete’ will be assigned until a decision is made. Students should contact the Director of the Office of
Students Affairs for further information regarding their rights.

It is important for students to follow the guidelines of the graduation booklet carefully and check with their
academic advisors frequently to be assured they are on the right track. Students will be asked to choose one
or two partners to work with on the Graduation Project. The approval of the academic advisor is required for
naming the group members.
Note: For more details please check with your department as well as The Graduation Project link on OSAR
website.
5.13.1. Academic Adviser
Academic advising is integral to the education mission of KUST. Advising is an intentional process, grounded
in teaching and learning, and provides each student with guidance for developing and achieving meaningful
educational, professional, and personal goals. As such, university assigns an academic advisor to each
student, to assist students in understanding the requirements necessary to complete their chosen major and
inform them about appropriate course sequences and course content.
Each student is assigned a faculty adviser in his or her major academic unit at the beginning of the first
semester of attendance. The adviser monitors the student’s academic progress toward a degree. A meeting
is held between the adviser and each student before registration to ensure that courses are scheduled in
proper succession, that all relevant academic policies are adhered to, and that the schedule best serves the
academic needs of the student. Once arranged, scheduled courses for undergraduates cannot be changed
without the adviser’s written permission, except for changes between sections of the same course before the
end of the first week of class. The faculty adviser is available throughout the academic year for consultation
by appointment, and students are strongly encouraged to seek the counsel of their faculty advisers in other
matters beyond registration and schedule changes.
Successful advising at KUST depends upon a shared understanding of, and commitment to, the advising
process, by students, advisors, and the university. Academic advisors engage students in learning, promote
students' academic success, and raise students' personal, ethical, and intellectual growth, all of which will
carry into their roles as citizens and lifelong learners.

PART SIX
6.1. Student Rights, Discipline, and Responsibilities
6.1.1. Student General Rights
●
The right of all students to seek knowledge, debate ideas, form opinions, and freely express their views
is recognized. This right must be exercised in a manner which will not interfere with the same rights and
freedoms of others in their enjoyment of the benefits of the programs offered by the university, or their
lawful use of university facilities, including ingress and egress. Such rights may be exercised subject to
applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures.
●
The right of freedom of peaceful assembly is recognized and shall be protected. Only those student
gatherings that do not disrupt the orderly functioning of the University and related activities shall qualify
as peaceful and therefore be protected. Meetings are included within the meaning of the terms
assemblies and gatherings.
●
Registered student organizations or individual students may hold meetings inside University buildings,
provided prior approval is granted by OSAR.
●
The right to peacefully demonstrate is recognized within the law of the Kurdistan Region.
●
Public address systems and other electrical amplification equipment may be utilized. All such use of
public address systems or other amplification equipment shall maintain a reasonable sound level which

●
Students have the right to celebrate their religious holy days, without missing a class.
6.1.2. Student Discipline
The disciplinary function at KUST is an integral part of the educational mission of the university. Since
behavior which is not in keeping with standards acceptable to the university community is often symptomatic
of attitudes, misconceptions, or emotional crises, the preferred treatment of these attitudes, misconceptions,
and emotional crises through the opportunity for reeducation and rehabilitative activities is an essential
element of the disciplinary process.
A humanistic approach to discipline is employed whenever possible. Severe disciplinary action against a
student is considered and invoked only when other remedies fail to meet the needs of the University’s
mission.
The University, however, recognizes its responsibilities to all members of the academic community, students,
faculty, and staff, and the protection of personal and institutional rights and property is a primary focus of the
disciplinary process.
Students facing disciplinary action are counseled of such by the University’s responsible officer of Student
Affairs. An appeal of the officer’s action may be made within a specified time frame to a panel composed of a
university administrator, faculty member, and student peer.
30
6.1.3. Student Code of Conduct
The Student Conduct Code applies the principles found in the Statement on Values and Moral Standards at
KUST by promoting responsible freedom for all students. Responsible freedom is exercised when actions are
directed by ethical standards. This Code seeks to apply the principle of responsible freedom as it guides the
conduct of KUST students. Moreover, the Code operates as a vehicle for informing students about their rights
and responsibilities while reinforcing the development of ethical standards that make responsible freedom
possible. The Statement of Values and Moral Standards at KUST is found in the current KUST Student
Handbook, which is incorporated herein by reference.
6.1.3.1. Definitions
Advisor: The term ‘advisor’ means any one person chosen by the charged student, victim, or witness to
assist throughout the disciplinary process, unless service in this capacity would reasonably conflict with the
fair application of the judicial process as determined by the Director (or designee) of OSAR.
Charged Student: The term ‘charged student’ means any student who has been formally charged with an
alleged violation of the Student Conduct Code.
Class day: The term ‘class day’ means any day that either classes or final exams are scheduled.
Hearing Body: The term ‘hearing body’ means any person or persons authorized by OSAR or Director of
University Housing to conduct hearings to determine whether a student has violated the Student Conduct
Code and to impose sanctions.
On-Campus: The term ‘on-campus’ means all land, buildings, facilities, and other property in the possession
of or owned, used, or controlled by the university, including adjacent streets, sidewalks, and parking lots.

31
6.1.3.2. Scope
KUST jurisdiction regarding discipline is generally limited to conduct of any student or registered student
organization that occurs on the University premises. In addition, the University reserves the right to impose
discipline based on any student conduct, regardless of location, when that conduct may adversely affect the
University community or its international programs. The University further reserves the right to restrict contact
with specified people.
The right of all students to seek knowledge, debate ideas, form opinions, and freely express their ideas is
fully recognized by KUST. This Student Code of Conduct will not be used to discipline the lawful expression
of ideas. Specific restrictions on time and place of meetings and assemblies are found in university rules,
regulations, or policies.
The processes for adjudicating violations of regional and federal law and violations of the Student Code of
Conduct are separate and may be pursued independently and simultaneously.
6.1.3.3. Authority
Authority for student discipline ultimately rests with the President, who delegates this authority either to the
Vice Presidents, or director, of student affairs. Under the direction of the President, the named administrators
are responsible for implementing the student disciplinary system. Either the President, the Vice President, the
Director of Student Affairs (or their designee), or resident directors/program leaders in international programs
may take direct jurisdiction of any case due to the inability of the appointed hearing officer to serve, or when it
is determined by the immediate circumstances that taking direct jurisdiction is in the best interest of the
university. The Director of Student Affairs has the authority to designate individuals as hearing or appellate
officers when appropriate.
The President (or designee) also has the authority to notify the person listed as the student’s emergency
contact (or other appropriate person) in case of an emergency involving that student.
All hearing bodies have the authority to consult with other appropriate university officials in order to resolve a
Student Conduct Code case effectively.
Decisions of administrative hearing panels are made as recommendations to the Vice President of Academic
Affairs.
Decisions of the Housing Judicial Board(s) are recommendations to the Assistant Director of Housing, or the
designee of the Director of Housing.
All recommended disciplinary decisions must be approved in writing by the appropriate administrator (or
designee) and only then will be communicated to the student. The appropriate administrator may adopt or
amend the recommended decision, or order a new hearing. Prior to amending or ordering a new hearing, the
administrator will confer with the appropriate hearing body. Upon approval, the recommended decision
becomes a first- level disciplinary action.
Decisions of all other hearing bodies constitute first-level disciplinary actions.
If a first-level disciplinary action is not appealed, that decision becomes final agency action.
Appellate decisions are considered recommendations to the Director of Student Affairs and become final
agency action upon approval by the President (or designee).

6.1.4. Rights of Students under Discipline
Notice: Students will be given clear and complete written notice of the Student Conduct Code charge(s) and
the allegations upon which the charge(s) is/are based.
Hearing: Students will be given an opportunity to present information, including witness testimony, during a
fair and impartial hearing. (A more complete description of the procedures utilized to implement these rights
is found in Section (6), Procedures).
6.1.4.1. Procedures
OSAR is charged with implementing the Student Conduct Code in ways that are congruent with the KUST’s
Statement on Values and Moral Standards and with all appropriate laws and administrative rules. The
procedures implemented by these offices will be consistent with all appropriate due process rights accorded
to students in university disciplinary decisions.
6.1.4.1.1. Charges
A review for possible charges may be initiated in the following ways:
●
Filing a police report with KUST's security personnel or requesting that a report from another law
enforcement agency be sent to the KUST security personnel.
●
Providing a signed statement to OSAR or University Housing. All information will then be reviewed by an
appropriate staff member in the OSAR or University Housing to determine whether Student Conduct
Code charges will be filed or if alternative action, including mediation, is appropriate. When possible,
reports should be submitted to either law enforcement or the appropriate administrator in a timely
manner.
35
6.1.4.1.2. Notice
The written notice given to any charged student will include the following:
●
Sufficient detail to prepare a defense (including source of information, alleged offense, and specific
Student Conduct Code charges).
●
An invitation to attend an information session, during which the student will view all materials related to
the case, receive instruction regarding the disciplinary process and the student’s rights, and confirm the
forum in which the case will be heard.
●
Notice of a formal hearing will occur at least five class days prior to the adjudication of the case. Informal
hearings will be scheduled at the convenience of the charged student and the hearing body.
●
Parent(s) of any student under the age of eighteen at the time of the alleged offense may also be notified
of pending charges.
●
The OSAR or University Housing may place a judicial hold on the records and registration of any student
who fails to address the Student Conduct Code charges in a timely manner. Any pending judicial matters
must be resolved prior to a student’s graduation, the release of transcripts, transfer of credits to another
institution, or re-enrollment at the university.
●
The address on file with OSAR will be used for all disciplinary notices sent to the student.
6.1.4.1.3. Hearing
Hearings will follow these guidelines:
●
All hearings will be fair and impartial and will use a reasonable standard when assessing whether the
information presented constitutes a preponderance of the evidence. A charged student may submit a
challenge to the impartiality of any member of a hearing body to OSAR or the hearing body.
●
A charged student will have the opportunity to present evidence on his or her behalf, including witnesses
and/or signed written statements.
●
The charged student, victim, and any witnesses may be accompanied during the hearing by an advisor;
the Student Defender may serve as an advisor. Students are required to address the hearing body in
person, on their own behalf, although they may consult with their advisor during the hearing. This
consultation must take place in a manner that does not disrupt the proceedings. The advisor shall not
speak on behalf of the student unless expressly authorized to do so by the hearing body. The charged
student, victim, or any witnesses shall provide the advisor’s name in writing to the OSAR or University
Housing two class days prior to the hearing. The advisor may not serve as a witness.
●
A student may choose not to answer any and all questions posed by a hearing body. This protection
from self-incrimination does not extend to student organizations.
●
The burden of proof at a first-level hearing always rests with the University. The standard of proof will be
the preponderance of the evidence, meaning that the evidence, as a whole, shows that the fact sought
to be proved is more probable than not.
●
All individual hearings will be conducted in private. If the charged student wants to have the hearing
open, the charged student must submit a written request for a public hearing to the Director of the Office
of Student Affairs or University Housing at least three class days prior to the hearing. Charges involving
alleged sexual misconduct will not be heard in public without prior written consent of all victims. After
receiving the consent of all victims in the case, the Director of the Office of Student Affairs may open the
hearing to the public.
●
All hearings for student organizations will be public. The director of OSAR (or designee) reserves the
right to limit the number of attendees.
●
All hearing decisions will be communicated in writing to the charged student and will include the findings
of fact, determination of responsibility, and sanctions imposed (if applicable).
36
●
Appropriate witnesses will be called by the university to all formal hearings. Those witnesses who
appear may be cross-examined by the charged student. If called witnesses do not appear, their written
or taped statements may be considered by the hearing body. In some cases, student witnesses who fail
to appear may be charged with a violation of the Student Conduct Code. Appropriate witnesses may
also be called by the charged student to all hearings.
●
If the charged student fails to appear at the scheduled hearing (after proper notice), the hearing may be
held in the charged student’s absence.
●
Prior records of disciplinary action and victim impact statements are considered by the hearing body only
in the sanctioning phase of deliberations.
●
The hearing body’s determination of ‘responsible’ or ‘not responsible’ will base solely on the information
presented at the hearing. However, when additional information that affects this determination is
gathered outside the hearing, it may be used provided it is shared with the charged student and the
student has an opportunity to respond to the information. In cases involving multiple students charged,
information provided at one hearing may be used as evidence in the related case(s).
●
To request the cancellation of a previously scheduled formal hearing, the charged student must submit a
written statement to OSAR five class days prior to the hearing date. At the discretion of the director of
OSAR (or designee), the hearing may be rescheduled or conducted in the charged student’s absence.
6.1.4.2. Types of Hearings
Two distinct types of hearings (informal and formal) are provided for by the Student Conduct Code. Informal
hearings typically can be scheduled more quickly than formal hearings and are usually better suited to cases
involving fewer questions of fact. Formal hearings may be more appropriate for cases involving more serious
alleged violations of the Student Conduct Code.
6.1.4.2.1. Formal Hearings
Require the hearing body to call appropriate witnesses to provide information in support of the charges.
Will be held no sooner than five class days after notice is received by the charged student. The student may
submit a written request to hold the hearing before the five days. The request will be considered by the Office
of Student Affairs.
Will be audio recorded. This recording will serve as the official record of the proceedings.
A formal decision letter will be sent to the student within ten class days from the conclusion of the hearing
process. This time limit may be extended if additional consideration of evidence and deliberation is required.
The following order of presentation is recommended for use in formal hearings. The hearing body may
change the order if necessary.
Presentation of formal charges
●
Opening statement by the university, followed by the opening statement of the charged student.
●
Presentation of evidence and witnesses by the university, followed by questioning of those witnesses by
the hearing body and the charged student. Witnesses are then dismissed.

witnesses by the charged student and the hearing body. Witnesses are then dismissed.
●
Questions directed to the charged student by the hearing body.
●
Closing statement by the university, followed by the closing statement of the charged student.
37
Informal hearings
●
The university does not automatically call witnesses to support the charges, although the hearing body
may gather any additional information needed, including calling witnesses. The charged student will be
informed of any additional information gathered by the hearing body. The charged student may call
witnesses and present evidence.
●
Are scheduled at the convenience of both the charged student and the hearing body.
●
Brief written decisions (including findings of fact) will serve as records of informal hearings and will be
communicated within ten class days of the hearing body’s final meeting with the student. This time limit
may be extended if additional consideration of evidence and deliberations are required.
●
The hearing may be audio recorded at the discretion of the hearing body.
●
Hearing Bodies and Authorities: Any specific procedures used by hearing bodies will comply with the
requirements of this Student Conduct Code. The range of available hearing bodies may differ on branch
campuses or International Programs.
○
The director of OSAR (and designee(s)) may conduct both informal and formal hearings on
individual or student organization cases.
○
The vice president of academic affairs or its designated hearing officer may conduct both informal
and formal hearings on individual or student organization cases.
○
University Housing hearing officers (Director, Assistant Directors and designers) may conduct both
informal and formal hearings regarding cases arising in University Housing in which the charged
student is a resident of University Housing.
6.1.4.2.2. Grievances
Students who allege that academic regulations and procedures have been improperly applied in specific
instances may have their grievances addressed through the general academic appeals process. In this
process, the student brings a complaint first to the instructor, then to the department chairperson, and finally
to the vice president of academic affairs appropriate to the course involved, stopping at the level at which the
complaint is resolved. If no resolution is reached, the student brings the complaint to the attention of the vice
president of academic affairs for either resolution or referral to the OSAR. OSAR has the authority to direct,
through the President (or designee), that corrective action be taken when justified.
6.1.4.2.3. Student Organizations and Activities
Student groups may peacefully assemble and may express opinions publicly and privately. Students have the
right to organize and join organizations to promote their common interests. These organizations are obligated
to receive official recognition and follow the guidelines of the University. Only approved organizations may
enjoy the rights and privileges accorded by the University including the right to invite speakers to campus to
address the group or student body. The University administration may cancel a speaker’s reservation when
there is a clear and present danger that the appearance would threaten the orderly operation of the
University.
6.1.4.2.4. University Holidays
For the holidays and no-class days students may refer to the annual academic calendar available on the
University website.
38
PART SEVEN
7.1. Examination Policy
At KUST, the examination policy is designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and academic integrity in the
evaluation
process.
The policy outlines the procedures and regulations governing the conduct of
examinations, including the responsibilities of both students and faculty members. It aims to create a
structured environment that promotes academic excellence and upholds the university's standards of
assessment. This policy covers all aspects of examinations, from preparation and scheduling to grading and
appeals, providing a framework for consistent and equitable academic evaluation. The objective is to
maintain high educational standards while fostering a culture of honesty and responsibility among students.
Note: For more details please check with your department as well as The Examination booklet link on OSAR
website.
39
PART EIGHT
8.1. Campus Security and Health Safety
The purpose of this guideline is to provide a framework for safety in the use of substances hazardous to
health.
8.1.1. Identification Card
Every student is issued an official identification card that must be carried on their person at all times. This
card is required for entry into various University facilities, as well as for participation in University services
and functions, such as food services, library access, and student elections.
The identification card is designed to last the duration of four academic school years. If a card is lost,
damaged, or stolen, the cost of replacement is 25000 Iraqi Dinars. If a card is malfunctioning because of
normal wear and tear, the cost of renewing it will be charged only. The replacement fee must be paid by cash
and cannot be charged to a student account.
ID cards are the property of KUST and are non-transferable; lending the ID card to anyone for any purpose is
prohibited and may result in disciplinary action. ID cards must be surrendered to University officials, including
campus security personnel, upon request; failure to comply may result in disciplinary action. Further, the card
must be presented for identification purposes to any University official upon request. The card becomes void
upon termination or interruption of enrollment and must be returned to the University.
8.1.2. Emergency
Emergency procedures are designed to give warning of imminent danger and to allow personnel to move to a
place of safety. The manager of each department is responsible for ensuring that all employees and visitors
within the area are informed of, and are fully conversant with, emergency procedures.
In case of a medical emergency KUST has a small clinic in the campus with all necessary First Aid tools and
at least two well-trained employees on campus to provide medical assistance to University community, as
well as to coordinate with local health authorities in the event a need arises. At the same time First Aid boxes
are accessible on each floor.
In case further medical treatment is required KUST’s clinical employee will contact the nearest hospital. In
case cost is incurred KUST will follow financial policies and arrangements for partial coverage. In this case,
the patient (student, staff, or faculty) is responsible for bearing the remainder of the cost of any professional
treatment. The University may provide escort service on campus when a sudden illness or injury occurs.
8.1.3. Safety in the Common Areas
Although offices, libraries, cafeteria, and other general areas may seem at first sight to be relatively,
non-hazardous compared to other areas of the University, they nonetheless can be the scene of a substantial
number of accidents, some of which may be serious. This includes but is not limited to misuse of electric
power sources and-hand-held sharp and cutting tools (tools range from scissors, glasses, fork, knives, pen
and pencils, etc.), and other possible hazards. While these tools are very different and can be used for a wide
variety of jobs, they all require that safety precautions be observed. If not handled properly, sharp-edged and
other cutting tools can cause cuts and puncture wounds. Physical encounters close to the windows or near
the stairs, lifts and horseplay, for example, are forbidden. University community members are advised to take
precaution while using these tools. Virtually all accidents of this nature are avoidable.
40
8.1.4. Fire Safety
8.1.4.1. General Fire Prevention
Fire is probably the most serious danger that most University personnel will ever have to face. It can break
out almost anywhere and can affect everyone.
Because prevention is obviously preferable than cure, implementing regular fire prevention routines are one
of the simplest and most efficient means of preventing fire. The value of the nightly routine of switching off
and unplugging electrical equipment, checking that gas fires and gas taps turned off, and closing the doors to
all rooms and staircase enclosures, cannot be overstressed.
Fire, with the possible additional risk of explosion, is a higher risk problem in laboratories and workshops
where flammable liquids and gases are often used. Strict precautions are required in these areas to ensure
that possible sources of fire or explosion are handled properly. A Bunsen burner or faulty thermostat may be
sufficient to start a fire. Welding and cutting equipment should never be used near flammable liquids or
burnable materials, unless adequate precautions are taken to prevent ignition from occurring. Written
instructions and signs should be displayed prominently on every floor in the campus.
8.1.4.2. Discovering a Fire
If you discover a fire:
➢Activate the nearest fire alarm.
➢Leave the building.
➢Ensure that a University employee has been informed of the location of the fire.
➢Hearing the Fire Alarm
➢On hearing the fire alarm
➢Leave the building immediately by the nearest available exit.
➢Close doors as you leave.
8.1.4.3. Means of Escape
It is essential that the means of escape from a building function efficiently. Fire doors play an important role in
the precautionary system; their purpose is to contain the fire, and prevent the spread of smoke and toxic
gases, which can be lethal even in small quantities. More people die through inhaling smoke than through
direct burns. Fire doors must therefore never be propped or wedged open; to prop open a fire door can cost
lives if a fire breaks out. Thus, all exit doors should be unlocked and able to be opened from the inside
without the use of keys. At the same time, exit routes must not be obstructed or used as storage areas.
Portable heating equipment or other sources of ignition must not be used in any part of an exit route.
All personnel are advised to become familiar with the exit and escape routes from the buildings in which they
normally work.
41
8.1.5. Health
It has often been said that it is better to be safe than sorry, and whilst this is easy to say, its realization
requires supportive structures and responsibilities, to be implemented across the University, in order to
ensure the maintenance of health and safety standards. Encourage staff to set high standards of health and
safety by personal example, in order that students leaving the University should take with them an attitude of
mind that accepts good health and safety practice as normal.
At KUST, safety is everyone's responsibility and all members of the University community are therefore
expected to be thoroughly familiar with their respective safety responsibilities, strive to follow safety practices

Access to computer systems and networks owned or operated by KUST impose certain responsibilities and
obligations and is only granted subject to University policies. Acceptable use must always be ethical, reflect
academic honesty, and observe restraint in the consumption of a shared resource. Computers demonstrate
respect for individuals, intellectual property, ownership of information, system security mechanisms, and
individuals' rights to privacy and to freedom from intimidation and harassment. All acceptable use of these
resources must be in accordance with the University Honor Code, and the policies outlined in this Student
Handbook. All KUST students are responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with these policies.
Acceptable use must demonstrate respect for:
●
The rights of others, including the right of privacy.
●
Intellectual property rights (e.g., as reflected in licenses and copyrights).
●
Ownership of data.
●
System mechanisms designed to limit access.
●
Individuals' rights to be free of intimidation, harassment, and unwarranted annoyance.
●
Policy toward violations.
KUST regards any violation of this policy as a serious offense.
9.2.8.2. Guidelines for Acceptable Use
In making acceptable use of resources, as a student you must:
●
Use resources only for authorized purposes.
●
Protect your user ID and the system from unauthorized use. (You are ultimately responsible for all
activities taking place under your user ID or that originate from your system).
●
Access only information that is your own, or is publicly available, or to which you have been given
authorized access.
●
Use only legal versions of copyrighted software in compliance with vendor license requirements.
●
Be considerate in your use of shared resources--refraining from monopolizing systems, overloading
networks, degrading services, or wasting computer time, connection time, disk space, printer paper,
manuals, or other resources.

9.2.9. Protecting Electronic Access Privileges
The University is responsible for assuring the integrity of its computing systems. At the same time, the
University strives to provide an open, accessible communications network in order to maximize the
functionality and usefulness of these resources. The integrity of shared computing resources depends upon
responsible behavior on the part of all users.
9.2.9.1. Password and Username
Computing systems are protected by a system of electronic authentication and authorization procedures that
rely on user passwords (PINs) and usernames (user IDs) for validation. It is the responsibility of all computing
and network users in the University community to safeguard the access privileges granted to them.
❖The owner of a user password (PIN) and user name (user ID) is exclusively accountable for its use. It is
the owner's responsibility to protect the integrity of accessible systems and to preserve the confidentiality
of accessible information as appropriate.
❖Unauthorized electronic access is prohibited.
❖Guidelines for managing your password
➢Passwords should be managed solely by the owner.
➢Passwords should remain confidential.
➢Passwords should follow the guidelines issued by the granting agency of the University.
➢Passwords should never be displayed, printed, or otherwise recorded in an unsecured manner.
❖Reporting Suspected Security Breaches
❖Anyone who has reason to suspect a breach of established security policy or procedure should promptly
report it to the appropriate Dean, Director, Department Head, or the Information Technology Services
Department.
❖Enforcement Regulations
➢User Responsibility:
All users of University computing resources are responsible for being aware of University policies
governing computing and communications resources.
❖Minor Infractions: Violations of these regulations will be referred to the University Committee on Student
Discipline, with a recommendation for disciplinary action subject to review and final action by the Director
of Students Affairs and a representative of the Information Technology Services Department. Action may
range from University sanctions to recommendations for legal action.
❖Mail Policy: In order to provide easy communication among students, faculty and staff, KUST aims to
provide a convenient, fast, functional, and reliable mail server. KUST’s goal is to support academic needs
at a reasonable cost in money and staff time. Accordingly,
❖KUST prohibits forwarding of messages from KUST student accounts to other services such as Hotmail
or Yahoo.
It is a responsibility of students as members of the KUST community to check their KUST
accounts regularly for messages from faculty and administrators. Students are of course welcome to
continue using their Hotmail, etc. accounts for their own, non-academic purposes.
❖Messages will be retained on the server for an interval equal to one hundred and eighty days (180).
Thereafter, they will be deleted on a rolling basis. Students who use an email client are encouraged to
58
download any messages they want to keep to their local machines, and delete them and any attachments
from the server on a routine basis.
❖A disk quota of 250 megabytes is allocated (enough room for hundreds of messages and some
multimedia files). A warning will be sent to students when the limit is approached, and if necessary,
messages will be deleted to bring the account under the limit.
❖If an email account is being used in conjunction with a class project, a request for additional, temporary
space may be sent via email to the KUST Support Center at ithelpdesk@komar.edu.iq
❖Accounts not accessed for 90 days that have exceeded the disk space allocation will have messages
over 30 days old that have originated from outside of KUST deleted. In addition, accounts in this category
that are subscribed to mailing lists will have their incoming messages rejected for two weeks to allow time
for list senders to delete those accounts from their lists.
9.2.9.2. Prohibited Activities
➢Transmitting unsolicited messages which constitute obscenity, harassment, or threats.
➢Communicating any information concerning any password, identifying code, personal identification
number or other confidential information without the permission of the controlling authority of the
computer facility to which it belongs.
➢Gaining or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, or making unauthorized use of, a computer facility
or software. This includes creating, copying, modifying, executing, or retransmitting any computer
program or instructions with the intent to gain unauthorized access to, or make unauthorized use, of a
computer facility or software.
➢Creating, copying, modifying, executing or retransmitting any computer program or instructions intended
to obscure the true identity of the sender of electronic mail or electronic messages, collectively referred to
as ‘messages,’ including, but not limited to, forgery of messages and/or alteration of system and/or user
data used to identify the sender of messages.
➢Accessing or intentionally destroying software in a computer facility without the permission of the owner of
such software or the controlling authority of the facility.
➢Making unauthorized copies of licensed software.
➢Using College information systems for commercial gain.
➢Illegally using copyrighted software and materials, storing such materials on College information systems.

59
9.2.9.3. Email Privacy
Electronic mail enables users to place information quickly and directly into another person's computer where
it can be retrieved, read, revised, stored indefinitely, downloaded, or responded to immediately. E-mail has
made employment and academic activities of the university more efficient by enabling us to make better use
of our time. While the University respects the privacy of electronic communications and makes every attempt
to keep email messages secure, privacy is not guaranteed.
KUST does not routinely monitor or access the content of e-mail messages whether stored on University
equipment or in transit on the University network. The content of electronic communications will not be
accessed during the execution of systems support, network performance, and related security functions; but
system administrators may access and disclose such contents when access and disclosure are necessary to
protect the integrity of information technology resources, to ensure that these resources are equitably shared,
to respond to health and safety emergencies, or to respond to summons, court orders, or other valid forms of
legal process. Where there is evidence of a criminal offense, the matter will be reported to KUST’s judicial
systems and/or law enforcement. The University will cooperate with the justice system in the investigation of
the alleged offense.
In addition, with appropriate authorization, the University will investigate complaints received from both
internal and external sources about unacceptable use of e-mail that involves KUST’s e-mail facilities and/or
KUST’s computer network. Requests to access or disclose the content of email will be governed within the
following guidelines. To avoid these problems, observe the following:
●
Refrain from disclosing your access codes/passwords to anyone.
●
Send email only from your personal email address.
●
KUST's e-mail system is for use by faculty, staff, and students in carrying out their employment and
academic activities. It is not intended for personal use.
●
Prior to sending an e-mail message, ask yourself whether you would feel comfortable if the text of the
message were posted on a KUST board on campus or printed in the newspaper. Would public disclosure
cause unnecessary embarrassment or create liability?
●
The privacy of e-mail sent or received on university equipment cannot be guaranteed.
●
Violating KUST’s Acceptable Use Outcomes
●
A violation of this policy constitutes misconduct, punishable under the Code of Conduct. Explicitly,
●
A violation of the terms and conditions of this Policy may result in immediate denial of computer/network
access or service and/or penalties that range from the loss of computing privileges to suspension or
expulsion from the University.
●
In the case of student violations involving the University administrative systems and data, the director of
OSAR will consult with the Data Owner concerned regarding the severity and impact of any proven
violation.
●
Policy violators are liable for any monetary payment or damages and may also be subject to civil or
criminal prosecution under regional laws and regulations.
●
The Office of Information Technology will not provide support to users who fail to follow the Acceptable
Use Policy.

APPENDIX XI 
  
GRADUATION PROJECT ASSESSMENT RUBRICS 
 
 
The student graduation project is made up of three components: 
 
1. The Graduation Project Research Paper 
2. The Graduation Project Poster 
3. The Graduation Project Presentation 
 
The basic component is the Research Paper. Both the Poster and the Presentation will be 
based on and derived from it. Therefore, the first rubric to be completed should be the 
Research Paper Rubric. Only after completing it can the evaluator move to the Graduation 
Project Poster Rubric. Then finally the evaluator should complete the Graduation Project 
Presentation Rubric. 
 
Each component has its own assessment rubric. Each rubric scores the component in 
question on a scale of 0 to 100. The three scores obtained from the application of the two 
rubrics will then be calculated according to the equation provided in this booklet in order 
to obtain the total GP score. 
 
Below are the two rubrics for the three GP components: 
 
1. The Graduation Project or Research Paper Rubric (R1) 
2. The Graduation Project or Research Paper Presentation Rubric (R2)
